<p>Since leaving Torres del Paine, we&rsquo;ve made our way slowly north by car, crossing the Chilean/Argentinean border three times and covering over 2000km of southern and central Patagonia.</p>

<p><img src="/worldtrip/rdtr/map.jpeg" alt="our odometer actually reads over 3000km, but whatever" /></p>

<p>We started out by crossing the border into Argentina. We used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Chaltén">El Chaltén</a>, at the foot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitz_Roy">Monte Fitz Roy</a>, as a base for a two-night backpacking trip. We even tried some mountaineering, and nearly reached the peak of Cerro Madsen (1806m).</p>

<p>At Lago Capri, where we stopped for lunch, we ran into Jon and Dani, a couple from San Sebastien who hitchhiked with us up to Torres Del Paine a week before. They had a similar destination, so we agreed to travel north together, and they ended up going with us nearly all the way to El Bolsón.</p>

<p>Our next destination was <em>Estancia la Angostura</em>, a hidden ranch, where we stayed a comfortable night after a long drive on dirt roads through the endless pampas. They let us feed the lambs fresh milk and then served us one for dinner.</p>

<p>From there, we drove north (nearly running out of gas after hundreds of kilometers with no open stations) to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perito_Moreno,_Santa_Cruz">Perito Moreno</a>; and after that west to Chile.</p>

<p>The difference was bewildering. The Patagonian Andes capture all the moisture blowing on westerly winds from the Pacific; we crossed within the span of thirty minutes from endlessly flat, arid steppe in Argentina to lush, green, rolling hills in Chile.</p>

<p><img src="/worldtrip/rdtr/chile_1.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We stopped for two nights in a small town between the border and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carretera_Austral">Carreterra Austral</a>, called Río Tranquilo. The town is situated on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Carrera_Lake">Lago General Carrera</a>, near some unique marble islets, carved by wind and acid rain into caverns reachable only by kayak.</p>

<p>The next few nights were spent in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Cisnes">Puerto Cisnes</a> (we were misinformed about the presence of penguins there), La Junta (featuring natural hot springs that we had to ourself), and finally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futaleufú,_Chile">Futuleufú</a>. The latter town is named after the river, which has excellent opportunities for whitewater rafting.</p>

<p>From there, it was a short drive to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Bolsón,_R%C3%ADo_Negro">El Bolsón</a>, a laid-back town with a hippie vibe on the Argentinean side. Our plan was originally to hike back to Chile and fly to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago">Santiago</a>; we&rsquo;ve had to adjust that.</p>

<p>Chile is currently in the midst of a large-scale political protest. In response to declining economic conditions, large crowds have gathered in most of the major cities to protest the right-wing government&rsquo;s reduction and privatization of public services. There have also been some riots and arson attacks on businesses and banks (and on the national energy company).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastián_Piñera">president</a> has made the situation much worse by instituting curfews and deploying soldiers and tanks to Santiago and other cities; the abuses of Pinochet are still fresh in people&rsquo;s minds, and that just intensified the protests. The young Chilean people we talked to in Puerto Río Tranquilo spoke softly but urgently about the need for institutional change.</p>

<p>We saw barely any hint of all that in the Patagonian backcountry; but we felt it would be an inappropriate time to play tourist in Santiago. Our new plan is to travel to Bolivia, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salar_de_Uyuni">Salar de Uyuni</a>, and do a long backpacking trip there. After that, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Desert">Atacama</a> awaits.</p>
