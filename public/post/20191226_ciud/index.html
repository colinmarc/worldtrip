<p>In the second century A.D., the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tairona">Tairona</a> people built a city in what is today the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Nevada_de_Santa_Marta">Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountains</a>, on Colombia&rsquo;s Caribbean coast. At the top of 1200 winding stone steps, 180 stone terraces were carved and built into the mountainside, straddling a waterfall. After the Spanish and their wars and plagues wiped out the Tairona, the city was lost to mainstream history. But in 1972, a family of treasure hunters stumbled on it, and named it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciudad_Perdida"><em>Ciudad Perdida</em></a>–the lost city.</p>

<p>We climbed those steps as well, but not before we hiked some 25km over two days, with a friendly group of fifteen people and two guides, through wet, sweltering jungle and along the muddy banks of the ice-cold Buritaca river.</p>

<p>The trail was wide, and we weren&rsquo;t alone; in high season, some 120 people a day start it (our group was about 30). For all these people to sleep, there were camps with bunkbeds; generally  at the riverside, with swimming holes for us to cool off from the day&rsquo;s exertions.</p>

<p>People descended from the Tairona, who escaped Spanish influence largely by being difficult to reach, still live in those mountains. We passed by their villages on our way, and shared the river with their children. They speak their own language, and are fanatically protective of their culture and traditions. With international tourism at their very doorstep, it&rsquo;s not hard to see why.</p>

<p>Each of the stone terraces of Teyuna, as those people still call it, covers the burial site of the family who lived there. After the city&rsquo;s &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; in 1972, grave robbers fought and even killed each other over digging rights. Word began to get out about the place, relics eventually started appearing in black markets, and the Colombian government finally reached and protected the site in 1976.</p>

<p>Some reconstruction was finished in 1982. Because of lobbying from local indigenous peoples, the city was and still is largely shielded from further plunder by international archaeologists. The number of yearly visitors was very small until 2003, when a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberation_Army_(Colombia)">guerrilla group</a> kidnapped several tourists on the trail and held them hostage for months. The incident put <em>Ciudad Perdida</em> into international headlines, which, ironically, only increased interest in the trek. When the trail opened a couple of years later, tourism began in earnest.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to imagine that tourism, and the hundreds of people a day, taking their toll on the city. The place and all its beauty rests on a knife&rsquo;s edge: balanced between political, international, humanitarian, and conservationist interests. Still, we were glad to see it, and to see it relatively undisturbed. It has not yet lost its magic.</p>

<p>On our way back to Bogotá, we spent an afternoon in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tayrona_National_Natural_Park">Tayrona</a>, a nearby national park named for the builders of Teyuna. There, the pristine beaches, crashing waves, and tiki beach bars at the edge of the jungle have left no trace of the people who once made it their home.</p>
