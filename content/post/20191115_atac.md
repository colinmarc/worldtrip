From [Hito Cajon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portezuelo_del_Cajón), at the border with Bolivia, we plunged all the way down to 2,400 meters above sea level, to [San Pedro de Atacama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Pedro_de_Atacama) in Chile. The [Atacama Desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Desert) is a long, thin strip of sand and [ignembrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignimbrite), the highest, driest [true desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_climate) in the world, starting in Chile and ending in Peru. We spent a week there, mostly dominated by trekking and other activities under the punishing sun.

In particular, we hiked two lofty volcanoes; first, [Cerro Toco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerro_Toco), seen above at a measly 5,604 meters, and second, [Sairecabur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sairecabur), at 5,971 meters.

The latter was uniquely difficult. It took us a bit more than two and a half hours to claw our way up scree and clamber and stumble over shattered boulders to the summit–a distance from the trailhead of only 1km and 300m of elevation gain. Constant dizziness made every step precarious. Still, our time was apparently a record for the two guides who accompanied us.

Feeling accomplished and exhausted, we said goodbye to Chile and our new friends, and boarded two short flights to [Bogotá](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogotá), where we are now. The overland, outdoors portion of our South American travels is now largely behind us; we'll spend a month here in the smoggy, bustling capital of Colombia (although we have some trips planned, to the coast).

Both the mass of people and the thickness of the air were initially a shock, after the clear emptiness of the pampas, altiplano, and desert. But it also feels a bit like coming home again.
