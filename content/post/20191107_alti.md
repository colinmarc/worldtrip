Leaving Patagonia's snow-covered peaks and wind-swept pampas behind, we headed for desert and volcano in Bolivia's [altiplano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altiplano), or highlands.

Two flights, a long bus, and a short coach ride brought us north to [Tupiza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupiza), a friendly city at 2850 meters above sea level in the department of Potosí of Bolivia.

After a short time spent acclimatizing to the elevation, we took a local tour another 200km north, to [Uyuni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyuni), at the edge of the famous [Salar de Uyuni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salar_de_Uyuni). The route took us nearly another kilometer higher, to 3600 meters, above stratified red-rock canyons, dotted with tall cactus, and past silver, copper, and gold mines.

Our first days in Bolivia–especially Uyuni–were challenging for us, but after a few days we came around. The streets are full of music and tasty food. The people are happy and affectionate.

Rather than brave the desert(s) alone, we started west into the Salar with a Bolivian tour guide, Carlos, and driver, Efrain. We had expectations about what the salt flat would be like; those were immediately and thoroughly defeated. It was overwhelming and incomprehensible.

The Salar is the cold, sun-frozen corpse of an ancient inland ocean. Some 40,000 years ago, it was cut off from the Pacific Ocean by tectonic movements (although this theory is controversial) and dried up. The leftover salt is nearly 180m thick in the center, and almost perfectly flat, because of a yearly crystallization process in which rainwater covers the area (forming the world's largest mirror) and then evaporates again.

In the middle of this endless white expanse, volcanic "islands" appear, carpeted in a crust of fossilized coral. The larger ones are home to micro-ecosystems of cactus, small rodents, and birds. We spent our first night in a tent on one of these islands, called [Incahuasi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incahuasi). We woke early to watch the rising sun swallow the countless stars, and couldn't shake the impression of being stranded on a milk-white ocean. It's a very surreal place.

Compasses famously don't work in the Salar, so one of the tricks you can use to navigate is to scan the horizon for [Tunupa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunupa), a massive dormant volcano on the northern edge of the flat. On our second day, we went to visit it.

Our guide planned a short hike for us, up to 4300m, where we reached the first viewpoint over the Salar. The hike was difficult; we fought with the thin and dry air, short of breath and struggling with painful headaches.

However, the view from this viewpoint was so impressive that we decided–without any real preparation or enough water or food–to climb up to the crater, at 4900m. The mountain pushed us to our limits; the last few hundred meters of elevation, through loose, Mars-red gravel, without water or enough air, and under the brutal sun, were exceptionally difficult. But the intense mineral green and blue of the crater and the view of the flat below were more than worth it.

After gratefully drinking a liter of water at the bottom, along with a short lunch, we crossed the flat again, to the southern edge. There, we spent the night in a "salt hotel", a refuge built out of mined salt bricks from the flat, a practice that's become common in recent years.

The next days took us to even more dizzying heights. As the salt desert turned to sand and rock, we visited brightly-colored volcanic lakes, dotted with flamingos; fields of wind-carved igneous rock; geysers and fumaroles; and, finally, at 5000 meters above sea level, a small refuge at the shore of a lake fed by hot springs, called Polques. There we joined other tour-goers for an evening pool-party in the thermal baths.

It's hard to put into words how small and insignificant those days left us feeling. Both the Salar and surrounding desert are powerfully, uniquely strange–and severe. Our bodies were wrung-out, dry, and burned. Never before have we been in a place that felt so much like another planet.

Still, we were sad to leave it behind. After crossing the border yesterday into Chile, we descended all the way down to 2400m, where the city of [San Pedro de Atacama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Pedro_de_Atacama), and our first hot showers in a week, awaited us. We'll spend a week here, in the [Atacama Desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Desert)–perhaps another 5000m volcano is in our future!
