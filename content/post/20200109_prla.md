For Christmas and New Years, we stopped in some (mostly) unfamiliar places for a chance to see some familiar faces. First was [Puerto Rico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_rico), where we met Colin's extended family for some quiet beachfront time.

Puerto Rico is still recovering from [Hurricane Maria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Maria), and [Humacao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humacao,_Puerto_Rico), on the Southeast Coast, sometimes felt a little desolate. That didn't get in the way of great time playing board games, card games, and pool volleyball. We also spent a day volunteering with [an organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Hands_And_Hearts_-_Smart_Response#Hurricane_Irma) that repairs and weatherproofs roofs that were damaged in the storms.

For the New Year, we flew to [Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles), where we met some old friends and rented a big house in Hollywood. It's winter in LA, but that didn't stop Colin from jumping in the pool. We celebrated with copious good food and drink, and a little dancing, too.

We've been enjoying traveling immensely, but it's a lonely thing. Being able to spend quality time with friends and family was a great comfort. To everyone that we didn't get to see this holiday season: we're thinking of you, and we miss you like crazy. Happy holidays and guten Rutsch!

Now we're on the road again. We're headed across the international date line to [Tonga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonga), in the South Pacific, where sun-warmed and coral-filled waters await us.
