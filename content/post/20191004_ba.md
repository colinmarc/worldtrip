We're in Buenos Aires, Argentina, our first stop.

It feels like we've taken a running leap off the ground, but haven't landed
anywhere yet. Suddenly, the year is stretching out before us. We've made sure to
take it easy, to pace ourselves. That's involved eating lots of good food.

We've seen only a tiny slice of Buenos Aires, which has a metro population of
almost 16 million people. We're staying in
[Palermo Soho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palermo,_Buenos_Aires), a young,
sleek, affluent neighborhood. It's clean and a little _too_ polished, in a way
reminiscent of parts of Williamsburg, in Brooklyn.

We also spent a day traveling outside the city, to Tigre, and saw the coastline
along the way. We took a decrepit tourist-oriented train line, [_Tren de la
Costa_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tren_de_la_Costa). Tigre seems like a
weekend destination for Buenos Aires families, and has a theme park and lots of
shopping.

More interesting, it's on the edge of the
[Paraná Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraná_Delta), a complex, populated
confluence of smaller rivers and canals. We took a short boat tour, and were
struck by the unique character of the place; posh private housing developments
face off with small communities of fishermen, and rusting cargo ships dot the
shoreline.

Tomorrow we'll fly to El Calafate, in Patagonia, and drive immediately to
Puerto Natales, in Chile.
