Heading west after the New Year, we stopped for a week in [Tonga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonga), a small south pacific kingdom consisting of more than 170 tiny islands. From the air, we could already see white sand beaches dotting the turqouise water–every little islet and atoll inviting us to stroll and swim.

We stayed on a northern island called [Vava'u](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vavaʻu). With a small population of about fifteen thousand, it's still the second most populated island in the whole kingdom. At the time we were there, it was very much low season–we felt like the only tourists around. Vava'u features fewer beaches, but dramatic cliffs along the north face, home to huge colonies of [flying foxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pteropus). After one day we'd seen most of the island–at least the part above water.

Tonga's greatest treasures, of course, are its reefs. We spent three full days diving among endless coral gardens, so thriving and full of life that we felt tiny and insignificant in comparison. Unfortunately, we don't own an underwater camera, so you'll have to take our word for it.

We've flown onwards to [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand) now, a very special place for both of us. And after such a peaceful time in Tonga, we feel ready to hike every mountain there.
