Since leaving Torres del Paine, we've made our way slowly north by car, crossing the Chilean/Argentinean border three times and covering over 2000km of southern and central Patagonia.

![our odometer actually reads over 3000km, but whatever](/worldtrip/rdtr/map.jpeg)

We started out by crossing the border into Argentina. We used [El Chaltén](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Chaltén), at the foot of [Monte Fitz Roy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitz_Roy), as a base for a two-night backpacking trip. We even tried some mountaineering, and nearly reached the peak of Cerro Madsen (1806m).

At Lago Capri, where we stopped for lunch, we ran into Jon and Dani, a couple from San Sebastien who hitchhiked with us up to Torres Del Paine a week before. They had a similar destination, so we agreed to travel north together, and they ended up going with us nearly all the way to El Bolsón.

Our next destination was *Estancia la Angostura*, a hidden ranch, where we stayed a comfortable night after a long drive on dirt roads through the endless pampas. They let us feed the lambs fresh milk and then served us one for dinner.

From there, we drove north (nearly running out of gas after hundreds of kilometers with no open stations) to [Perito Moreno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perito_Moreno,_Santa_Cruz); and after that west to Chile.

The difference was bewildering. The Patagonian Andes capture all the moisture blowing on westerly winds from the Pacific; we crossed within the span of thirty minutes from endlessly flat, arid steppe in Argentina to lush, green, rolling hills in Chile.

We stopped for two nights in a small town between the border and the [Carreterra Austral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carretera_Austral), called Río Tranquilo. The town is situated on [Lago General Carrera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Carrera_Lake), near some unique marble islets, carved by wind and acid rain into caverns reachable only by kayak.

The next few nights were spent in [Puerto Cisnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Cisnes) (we were misinformed about the presence of penguins there), La Junta (featuring natural hot springs that we had to ourself), and finally [Futuleufú](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futaleufú,_Chile). The latter town is named after the river, which has excellent opportunities for whitewater rafting.

From there, it was a short drive to [El Bolsón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Bolsón,_R%C3%ADo_Negro), a laid-back town with a hippie vibe on the Argentinean side. Our plan was originally to hike back to Chile and fly to [Santiago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago); we've had to adjust that.

Chile is currently in the midst of a large-scale political protest. In response to declining economic conditions, large crowds have gathered in most of the major cities to protest the right-wing government's reduction and privatization of public services. There have also been some riots and arson attacks on businesses and banks (and on the national energy company).

The [president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastián_Piñera) has made the situation much worse by instituting curfews and deploying soldiers and tanks to Santiago and other cities; the abuses of Pinochet are still fresh in people's minds, and that just intensified the protests. The young Chilean people we talked to in Puerto Río Tranquilo spoke softly but urgently about the need for institutional change.

We saw barely any hint of all that in the Patagonian backcountry; but we felt it would be an inappropriate time to play tourist in Santiago. Our new plan is to travel to Bolivia, to [Salar de Uyuni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salar_de_Uyuni), and do a long backpacking trip there. After that, [Atacama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Desert) awaits.
