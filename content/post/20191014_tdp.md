There are many national parks in Patagonia. Of course, we picked the most impressive one as our first destination: [*Parque Nacional Torres Del Paine*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_del_Paine_National_Park), in Chile. Time will tell if that was the right choice. In any case, our time there left us breathless and humbled.

After one night in [Puerto Natales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Natales), a small city on the Chilean pacific fjords near the Argentinean border, we drove with two hitchhikers into the park. The previous days had been freezing and snowy, but that day the sun lit up the mountains spectacularly.

After ditching the hitchhikers, we followed a small road and were greeted with our first view of the *Torres* and *Cuernos* of the Paine Massif. Words can't really capture how we felt; here are some photos.

As the days flew by, we never lost that feeling. Somehow the mountains and glaciers surprised us every time we turned a corner; even as the weather rapidly changed from driving rain and snow to dense fog to brilliant sunlight, they were steadfastly, powerfully present.

The inexhaustible guides of our hotel led us on long treks around the massif and to obscure corners of the park, through rain, snow, and once even 100km/h wind. Our favorite hike took us up through sunny forest and over swinging cable bridges to a lookout above an electric-blue glacier.

As of today, we're in [El Chaltén](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Chaltén), on the Argentinian side, at the foot of [Fitz Roy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitz_Roy). Tomorrow we'll head up to camp somewhere in its shadow.
