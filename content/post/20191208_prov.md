Bogotá has started to feel a bit like home, and we're glad to be back in a big city, with all the comforts that entails. But we've been sure to punctuate our stay with trips to warmer climes. After our first week we made a short trip to [Providencia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providencia_Island,_Colombia), a Carribean island belonging to Colombia off the eastern coast of Nicaragua.

The way there brought us through [San Andres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Andrés_(island)), a larger and more populated–but still very remote–island that reminded us a bit of Mallorca. From there, we took a four-hour catamaran ride through stormy seas to Providencia, which has only five thousand residents.

The place has charm to spare. It's relaxed and friendly, in the mold of other Caribbean paradises, with a bit of Colombian flair; the population is mostly Afro-Carribean, but speaks Spanish as well as a [creole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Andrés–Providencia_Creole). Besides jungle-carpeted mountains, turquoise seas, and pale beaches, the island features one of the longest coral reefs in the world.

Eva took the opportunity to do her first Scuba certification, and got to encounter a swarm of reef sharks. Colin came along and did some [freediving](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5a1N4cJWRo/) where he could.

Our last night we were treated by our hosts to [rondón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_down), a traditional stew of seafood, plantains, and coconut. It was a tough place to leave, but we knew we'd be back to the Caribbean before long.
