New Zealand is a unique place–it's both temperate and tropical, isolated and developed, wild and deeply agricultural. It's a special place for Eva, where she first traveled by herself. And it's significant in that it marks a halfway point for us–halfway around the world (nearly antipodal of Berlin, in fact) and six months through our year. We set aside six weeks for New Zealand, and ended up moving our flights back to have more time here.

We started in the north of the north island, flying into [Auckland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland). After a day or two in the city, we took a rental car north, into [Northland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northland_Region), and stayed in [Tutukaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutukaka), with a view out to the [Poor Knights Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poor_Knights_Islands). We had the opportunity to dive there, and also hiked along Northland's breezy, warm coastline.

For Colin's birthday, we did some paragliding near Auckland. We camped on a black sand beach west of [Waiuku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiuku) for more than a week, swimming in the frigid ocean every morning and soaring above the cliffs under the hot sun. We're still toting around the used glider that Colin bought, and he's now finished an international paragliding certification. We also visited [Coromandel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coromandel_Peninsula), on the East coast, for a day one weekend.

We worked our way south after that, hiking [Mt. Taranaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taranaki), a uniquely symmetric volcano on the West Coast, and [Tongariro Crossing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongariro_Alpine_Crossing), near [Taupo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taupo), with two twelve year olds. Tongariro is part of a uniquely Volcanic area in the North Island. It's the site of several recent eruptions, and also displays evidence of more ancient, devastating ones. We got lucky with the weather: a wind warning dissuaded most of the daily crowd (the trail sees 75,000 hikers a year) and we had it more or less to ourselves.

Before we crossed the [Cook Straight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Strait), we spent nearly two weeks outside Wellington, staying with some family friends of Eva's in a beautiful house on the hill that quickly felt like home. Before long, though, it was time for yet another set of difficult goodbyes. We set off towards the South Island, where the weathered mountains and wild coastlines have their own particular set of contrasts.
